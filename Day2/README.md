## What is Hypervisor ?
- Virtualization Technology
- helps us run multiple Operating System on the same laptop/desktop/workstation/server
- mutiple OS can be active at the same time on the same machine
- this is a Hardware + Software technology
- We need Processor that supports Virtualization
- AMD processor
  - Virtualization feature supported by AMD Processor is AMD-V
- Intel processor
  - Virtualization feature supported by Intel Processor is VT-X
- There are two of hypervisors softwares
  - Type 1 
  - Type 2
- Type 1 Hypervisor
  - used in servers/workstations
  - this doesn't require an Operating System to be installed to create Virtual Machines
  - this is also called as Bare Metal Hypervisor
  - Examples
    - VMWare vSphere/vCenter
- Type 2 Hypervisor
  - used in laptops/desktops/workstations
  - this requires an OS to install the Hypervisor
  - Examples
    - VMWare
      - Fusion ( Mac OS-X ) - requires license
      - Workstation ( Windows & Linux ) - requires license
    - Microsoft Hyper-V ( Windows ) - comes with server grade windows
    - Oracle VirtualBox ( Linux, Windows & Mac ) - Free  
    - KVM ( Linux ) - opensource & Free
